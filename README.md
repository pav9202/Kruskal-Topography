Kruskal-Topography
==================
Code to map out the topography of an image using Kruskals algorithm. 

We take advantage of the fact that during iterations of Kruskal's minimum spanning tree algorithm you form forests rather than trees as in Prim's. As such you may form a topography of an image by mapping each iteration of Kruskals to a layer on a 3-dimensional mapping.
